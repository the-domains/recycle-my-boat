Boating is fun. It starts as a dream. Like any dream, it can sometimes turn rather unpleasant. An amazing dream of owning and using a boat can turn into a nightmare. Storage, moorage, survey, mechanic, fuel, insurance, to name only a few, make up the submerged side of an iceberg.

A modern boat is a complex machine that if left to decompose on its own can pollute for even as long as a couple centuries. So experts are needed to safely dismantle a vessel at the end of its life. Fuel, lubricating and hydraulic oils, coolant and other pollutants have to be recovered and turned to appropriate facilities for safe disposal.

Apart from sources of pollution, a modern boat contains various metals in different form. In order to preserve resources, all that metal can be recycled for cash, yielding a return to the owner.
